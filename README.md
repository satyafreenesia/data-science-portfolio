# Satya Freenesia â€” Data Science Portfolio

Hi, I'm Satya ðŸ‘‹  
This repository contains 3 Python Jupyter notebooks and 1 SQL case study.  
Each notebook includes instructions to download the dataset from Kaggle (using the Kaggle CLI), EDA/cleaning/visualization, and concise insights.

## Projects
1. 01-data-cleaning â€” Supermarket Sales Cleaning (Kaggle dataset)
2. 02-exploratory-analysis â€” Telco Customer Churn EDA (Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn)
3. 03-machine-learning â€” Housing Price Prediction (Kaggle: Ames / House Prices)
4. 04-sql-project â€” Chinook Invoice & Sales Analysis (Chinook sample DB)

## How to use
1. Install kaggle CLI and authenticate (place kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/). See: https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api
2. From each project folder, run the notebook. Each notebook contains the exact `kaggle datasets download` command to fetch the data.
3. If you prefer, download datasets manually from Kaggle and place them in the project's `data/` folder.
